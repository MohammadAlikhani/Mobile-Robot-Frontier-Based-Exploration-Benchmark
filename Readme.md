This project benchmarks a **hybrid frontier-scoring rule** and a **distance-triggered replanner** to cut total travel during autonomous map exploration.  
Across **48 Gazebo / ROS 2 simulations** (small + large maps), the combo **Œ± = 0 .2** (frontier-size bias) and **Œ≤ = 0 .6** (replan when 60 % of the path remains) reduces travel by ‚âà 10 % versus the classic ‚Äúclosest frontier + static replans‚Äù baseline.

## üåê Concept

Frontier exploration chooses the next **frontier cell cluster** to visit.  
Two extremes:

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Closest** | Low step-cost, energy-efficient | May harvest little new space |
| **Largest** | Maximises info gain | Wasteful detours on small maps |

## üî¨ Research Questions& Hypotheses
| ID | Question | Hypothesis |
|----|----------|------------|
| **RQ1** | Does a weighted combination of frontier *size* vs. *distance* (parameter Œ±) lower distance vs. pure strategies? | **H1** ‚Äî ‚àÉ Œ± ‚àà (0, 1) that beats Œ± = 0 (closest) & Œ± = 1 (largest). |
| **RQ2** | Does triggering a re-plan when only a fraction Œ≤ of the path remains reduce detours? | **H2** ‚Äî Replanning when 0<d<Œ≤√ópath lowers distance vs. static replan. |
| **RQ3** | Is there an interaction between Œ± and Œ≤? | The optimal Œ± depends on Œ≤ (and vice-versa). |

We propose a **weighted score** plus a **dynamic replan trigger**:

## Hypotheses

### H‚ÇÅ (Weighted score)

We define a scoring function that balances **frontier size** and **distance**:

```math
\text{score}(f)
  = \alpha \,\frac{\text{size}(f)}{\max \text{size}}
  - (1-\alpha)\,\frac{\text{dist}(f)}{\max \text{dist}}  
```

There exists an $$( \alpha \in (0, 1) \)$$ that yields **lower total travel** than:

$$\( \alpha = 0 \)$$ ‚Üí pure closest (nearest-frontier)

$$\( \alpha = 1 \)$$ ‚Üí pure largest (largest-frontier)

---

### H‚ÇÇ (Adaptive replan)

If we abort and pick a new goal whenever:

```math
0 < \text{D}_\text{remaining} < \beta \times \text{(planned path length)}
```

Then we avoid long detours and further reduce total travel distance.

## üéõÔ∏è Variables

### 1. Independent Variables

- $$\( \alpha \)$$: the weight between "frontier size" and "frontier distance" in your goal-scoring function.
- $$\( \beta \)$$: the fraction of planned path length at which you trigger a replan.
- **Exploration Strategy Variants**: pure "closest" $$\( \alpha = 0 \)$$, pure "largest" $$\( \alpha = 1 \)$$, or hybrid weighted.
- **Replan Strategy Variants**: only abort on success/abort, versus distance-based, versus time-based, or combinations.

### 2. Dependent Variable(s)

- **Total distance traveled** (our primary metric).

## üèóÔ∏è Simulation and Results

- **Platform**: ROS 2 Humble ¬∑ Nav2 ¬∑ Gazebo  
- **Maps**: small (‚âà 50 √ó 50 m) and large (‚âà 120 √ó 120 m)  
- **Runs**: 4 Œ± √ó 4 Œ≤ √ó 3 repeats = **48** sims per map

| Map   | Best $$\alpha$$: | Best $$\beta$$ | Mean distance |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| Small  | **0.2** | **0.6** | **33.199 m**   |
| Large  | **0.2** | **0.6** | **90.271 m**   |

## üèóÔ∏è About the Package

This package was developed for Mobile Robotics and Navigation (MRN) of the Master in Automation and Robotics (MUAR) of the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC).

This project is performed on Turtlebot4 lite platforms simulated and real.

### 1. Dependencies

For these practices you will need a PC with Ubuntu 22.04 and ros humble installed (ros-humble-desktop-full recommended).

Apart from ROS humble, the following dependencies are required for the practices. They all can be installed via apt:
- ssh
- git
- python3-colcon-common-extensions
- ignition-fortress
- ros-humble-rplidar-ros 
- ros-humble-rqt-tf-tree
- ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-simulator 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-desktop 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-navigation 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-node 
- ros-humble-turtlebot4-tutorials

#### 1.1. Setup script

For the students convenience, we provide an script to install the dependencies, configure a ros workspace (~/ros2_ws) and clone this package, in your personal laptop (Ubuntu 22.04 and ros humble required).
This script needs to be executed once. 

First, download the script:

```bash
wget --no-check-certificate -O mrn_setup.sh http://bit.ly/upc_mrn_laptop
```

Terminal output should say it downloaded the file successfully, otherwise, try again. 
Then, execute the script (your password will be required):

```bash
source mrn_setup.sh
```

Check that no errors occurred and then you can remove the script and the logs that were generated (rm mrn_setup.sh log_mrn_setup.log).

### 2. Example

#### 2.1. Compile `upc_mrn`

To check that everything is working you need first to compile the upc_mrn package:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws && colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to upc_mrn
```

#### 2.2. Simulation of turtlebot4 lite

And then, launch the simulation (gazebo ignition) of the Turtlebot4 lite (rgbd camera is not simulated for efficiency) in a room-like environment:

```bash
ros2 launch upc_mrn sim.launch.py world:=rooms gui:=false
```

**`sim.launch.py` arguments:**

- `gui`: Whether launch the gazebo GUI or not. (default: `true`)
- `world`: which world to load. Available: `empty`, `rooms`, `simple`, `large`, `small`. (default: `empty`)
- `x`, `y`, `yaw`: initial pose of the robot. (default: origin)
- `oak`: Whether a robot with the plugin of the OAK rbd camera or a robot without it. (default: `false`)

#### 2.3. SLAM_toolbox

In this example we will run the `slam_toolbox` to create a map of the environment.
In another terminal, run the launch:

```bash
ros2 launch upc_mrn slam.launch.yaml
```

Then, the visualization (RVIZ2) in a third terminal:

```bash
rviz2 -d ~/ros2_ws/src/upc_mrn/rviz/slam.rviz
```

And finally, to move the robot, run the `teleop_twist_keyboard` node in a fourth terminal:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

#### 2.4 Navigation

Instead of the teleoperation, we can launch the navigation (nav2) with a launch also provided:

```bash
ros2 launch upc_mrn nav.launch.yaml
```
